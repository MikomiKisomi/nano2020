    an "The guilt, though it subsided after Zaina consoled me, returns with a vengeance when I don't see her for a couple of days."

    an "It eats at me over breakfast, on the drive to school, and even during my classes."

    an "I relive the moment over and over in flashes, and the sound of the camera hitting the ground haunts my dreams after that night. I don't sleep very well for a while."

    an "So long the memories of Zaina's soft touch..."

    an "However, a free day finds me in my apartment, at my desk, laptop open."

    an "I Google ‘best camera for pictures' and intend to spend hours skimming through lists and narrowing down the camera with the best specs."

    an "If I were to really buy her a replacement, only the best would suffice for Zaina!"

    an "Also, I had absolutely no idea what kind of camera the one she owned was..."

    an "One look at the prices, however, has my stomach dropping. I didn't realize they were so expensive."

    an "I revise my search to ‘best {i}cheap{/i} camera for pictures' but even those were outside my budget. Way outside my budget."

    an "On the cusp of giving up, I wonder out loud to myself if the cafe Paxton works at is hiring and for a few moments, I actually entertain the thought of working there."

    an "But I shake the thought, tempting as it is. Not only would it take me forever to gather enough money, if my parents heard that I was wasting ‘precious study time' on a job, they'd have my head for it."

    an "Still, it doesn't stop me from asking Paxton how much he makes per hour."

    an "Just y'know... In case."

    an "It's when I eagerly await Paxton's response that I get texts from Zaina."

    ##phone buzz
    "Bzz..." with vpunch

    an "They're texts telling me not to worry about the camera—"

    an "I spare a glance at my laptop screen, where a list details the pros and cons for each of the twenty cameras catalogued. A little too late for that."

    an "—and that it's all fine."

    an "She even sends me heart emojis, which I suspect is her way of cheering me up."

    an "It works. A little."

    an "It doesn't dispel any of the doubt I feel about Zaina's true feelings on the incident, but it does ease some of the weight on my shoulders."

    an "Zaina's not ignoring me, at least, so that's a marked improvement from last time."

    an "That she even bothered to text me when she could've very easily blocked or ghosted me again means that she hasn't given up on our relationship."

    an "And that she's still thinking of me, even after what I did."

    an "I expel a shaky breath and once again return to my laptop."

    an "Forgiveness isn't going to come easy, from myself at least, but even if she's angry, I'd rather have her angry and in my life than not at all."

    an "Paxton gets back to me later, though I don't apply for a job at the cafe. It does motivate me to be more proactive about saving, however."

    an "The next two days, I budget out every purchase. If I don't need it, I don't buy it."

    an "It gives me some peace of mind—knowing that while I certainly can't cash out the money for a camera right now, I can chip in and help Zaina out."

    an "Maybe it's selfish, doing so to alleviate my guilt, but in the end it's all for one thing: to get Zaina to smile."

    an "And not with pity for me like before, either, but a genuinely happy smile."

    an "I allow myself to imagine it while I pour over my textbook."

    an "The words on the paper blend together into nothingness and I prop my chin up with a hand, thinking of crooked smiles and hints of teeth more blinding than her camera's flash."

    an "The images have me in such a vice-grip that I almost don't notice the sound of an incoming call."

    ##phone ringing
    "Rinng..." with vpunch

    an "I mark my place in my textbook, shake my head free of my fantasies, and then reach for my phone. I look at the contact information."

    an "It's Zaina."

    an "I pick up immediately."

    a "Hello?"

    an "A sharp intake of breath answers me and I straighten in my chair, tempted to take one of my own. That's not a good sign."

    an "Zaina's no fan of phone calls as it is, but the few I've had with her have been lighthearted, usually when she's just across the room and wanting to whisper a joke, often at the expense of someone in that room."

    an "This is clearly something else altogether."

    z "It's Finn... he's—"

    an "Her voice breaks, though whether it's because she's overwhelmed or just doesn't know what to say, I can't say for certain. Probably both."

    an "She gathers herself together quickly, though, and I can {i}feel{/i} the urgency of the situation bleeding through the phone."

    z "He's gone off by himself somewhere—"

    z "And he's hurt. Real bad."

    an "The fact that Zaina doesn't spare any time berating Finn for his actions tells me all that I need to know about the situation. There must be no time at all."

    a "Do you have the address to the place?"

    z "Ye—yeah, I'll send it to you right now."

    a "Alright, I'll meet you there. Is there anything you need me to bring?"

    z "Your first-aid kit, just in case."

    z "Cardboard, if you have any."

    z "Belts would be useful, too."

    an "Cardboard? {i}Belts{/i}? My lips pull into a grimace as I put it together."

    an "There's really no time to lose, then. If Finn's really broken something, then we'd have to hurry or else he might go into shock, waiting all by himself like that."

    a "I'll see you in a bit."

    z "Okay..."

    an "There's silence on the line and I almost think she's hung up, but then—"

    z "... Alex?"

    a "Yeah?"

    z "Thank you."

    an "The call ends this time and I allow myself a moment to just breathe, knowing I won't have the chance to do so again once I leave my place."

    an "No time to lose!"

    an "I proceed to turn my apartment upside down looking for the materials Finn needs for his splint."

    an "Any remaining thoughts of broken cameras and broken trust begin to slip from my mind as I focus only on Finn and getting to him as fast as possible."

    an "When I push against the speed limit as far as I can without getting pulled over, fear is the prevailing emotion that courses through my veins, not guilt."

    ##scene fourteen
    ##mansion bg
    scene bg mansion
    with fadee

    an "Normally, I would be parking a couple blocks away from the site for insurance, but considering Finn's situation, I park as close as I can to the mansion."

    an "I pull up just in front of it and hurry out my car, splint materials in my arms."

    an "It's awkward carrying everything together and I'm a lot slower because of it, but I don't want to risk a second trip when I don't know how long Finn's been waiting."

    ##engine sound effect
    "Vrumm..." with vpunch

    an "I've just about reached the door when Zaina arrives. I hear her, rather than see her—the motorcycle's engine giving her away."

    an "I don't look over to confirm it's her, preoccupied with getting the door open, but she's by my side in a flash, moving with a speed and urgency I've never seen from her before."

    an "She takes the cardboard from me, freeing up my hands as we enter together."

    an "The sound of my heart thudding loudly in my ears fills the eerie silence."

    a "Finn?"

    an "I'm careful not to yell as the last thing we need is the police here. I speak in what I think is a good volume, for anyone inside to hear me."

    an "But only silence answers me and Zaina and I look at each other, worried."

    an "Had Finn passed out?" 

    an "My lips part to try again, only louder this time, but a voice, sounding more bashful than weak, reaches us from upstairs."

    ##small text, as he's probably wheezing this out
    f "{size=12}Up here...{/size}"

    an "Zaina wastes no time climbing up the stairs, two at a time, and I follow her, though a little more carefully."

    an "I trust Zaina, given how long she's been doing this, but it wouldn't do anyone any good if I got myself hurt too."

    an "There's no telling what else could be weak and rotting."

    an "I keep an eye on the floors and any holes in them, and after calling for him a few more times, we locate Finn, in a pile of what probably used to be part of the third floor."

    an "Zaina is on him in an instant."

    an "Still, the way his right leg is bent like that doesn't look good, even if he is lucky to only come away with that after a fall from the third floor."

    ##neutral alex
    an neutral "Closing my eyes, I try to recall what I've learned in class."

    an "Shock... What are the symptoms of shock...?"

    an "I press a hand against his forehead, while the other checks for his pulse."

    an "His skin doesn't feel clammy... and his pulse is a little fast, but not alarmingly so. It's not weak either."

    a unsure frowntalk "He doesn't seem to be experiencing shock."

    an "Zaina then resumes her inspection of Finn's leg, who hisses when her fingers brush upon a certain spot. I take the opportunity to apply disinfectant to his cuts and scratches while he's distracted."

    z down frowntalk "Yeah, that's definitely broken..."
    show zaina frown

    a unsure frowntalk "At least the bone didn't break the skin."
    show alex frown

    an "What could be worse than this?"

    an "I look at Finn again, and almost miss the way his shoulders lightly shake with mirth."

    an "He's clearly subdued, as if there was something that still had a tight grip on him, but it seems he's able to joke about it, at least."

    an "This discovery eases my mind some, and I'm able to devote the rest of my attention to securing the splint with the belts without much worry for Finn's safety."

    an "It's when we're putting the last belt on that he speaks again."

    f unsure talk "Thank you."
    show finn smile

    an "He's looking at both of us, but I feel this is more for Zaina's benefit than mine."

    f up talk "I'm glad I called you."
    show finn smile

    z down talk "Sh-shut up."
    show zaina smile

    an "Zaina just avoids his eyes and finishes securing on the belt. When she's done, she clears her throat."

    an "She does this a couple of times."

    z unsure talk "Alright. We're done here."

    z up frowntalk "We've done all we can with the leg, but we have to get you to a hospital."
    show zaina frown

    f down talk "Okay."
    show finn frown

    an "Good. Finn is smart enough not to argue."

    z unsure frowntalk "I can't take you there on my bike, though. I don't want to, but it looks like we'll have to call an ambulance..."

    ##shocked alex

    an "I doubt any of our insurance covers it."

    a up shock "W-Wait! We can take my car."

    a unsure frowntalk "We'll have to carry him down, but..."
    show alex frown

    an "That was a better idea than calling for one and having the police show up too. Finn was technically trespassing."

    an "Finn looks between us and shrugs, appearing as if he accepted his fate either way."

    f unsure talk "I'm fine with whatever Zaina decides."
    show finn smile

    an "With the decision up to her now, Zaina falls silent. I don't have to know her very well to see the uncertainty on her face."

    an "It's in her furrowed brows and her frown. She's usually not this serious if she can help it."

    an "But finally, she makes up her mind."

    an "Zaina bends down to sling one of Finn's arms around her shoulder. She gestures for me to do the same."

    an "The hospital staff take him away to the emergency room when we arrive. I reassure Finn we'll be staying, through the night if necessary, but he declines vehemently, and says he can call a cab home, so we shouldn't bother."

    an "One look at Zaina after he's gone tells me she doesn't like the idea, though."

    an "I don't either. I want to make sure he's okay, just as much as Zaina."

    an "But as a compromise, I call Paxton during a lull, to tell him what happened."

    an "He's as shocked as anyone would be. Fortunately, he's nearing the end of his shift, so he can head over soon. Paxton promises to call when he arrives and that he'll keep us updated on Finn's status."

    an "This frees me and Zaina up to go home, and I feel a little less guilty than if we'd just left Finn there alone."
