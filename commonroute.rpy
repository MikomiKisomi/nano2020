    an "With her grinning like that, a life spent getting teased by Zaina couldn't be {i}too{/i} bad."

    an "In fact, as she settles down beside me, arm around my shoulder to keep us both warm, I'd say I'd be lucky to have her in my life for nearly half as long."

    a talk "What were you taking pictures of?"

    an "I can't say I wasn't curious as to what could've kept her attention for so long."

    an "I pout, again, and she must feel sorry for me because she decides to throw me a bone."

    an "Not before laughing first, though."

    z talk "Mostly constellations."

    z talk "They're really clear tonight."

    an "I look up. I don't know much about constellations except the Big Dipper and I don't see that one now."

    an "I squint to see if it'd help any, but it doesn't."

    an "The stars, while visible and very pretty, are all indistinguishable to me."

    an "I was never one to stargaze anyway. My parents made sure I put my time to better use."

    an "So while I could probably name a lot of them, I was as good as lost trying to find them in the sky."

    z talk "You can't see them, can you?"
    show zaina smile

    an "I shake my head."

    z talk "Probably ‘cause we don't have a telescope or binoculars."
    show zaina smile

    z talk "I could see them through my camera, at least."

    z talk "But, see, that one there..."
    show zaina smile

    an "Zaina traces a pattern in the sky and I follow it with my eyes."

    z talk "Doesn't it look like Finn's ass?"

    an "Any hope I have of stifling my laughter goes out the window. My shoulders shake despite my best attempts and when I reach out to point out something in the sky, it's difficult to keep my finger still."

    a talk "That one there looks like Paxton's hat."
    show alex smile

    an "She tilts her head and traces the pattern I pointed out with a finger."

    z talk "{i}Nice{/i}."

    z talk "Oh, look at that one—"
    show zaina smile

    an "We continue on like that for a while. It's hard to keep track of all the constellations we make up, but by the end of it, Zaina's in a good enough mood that when I ask her if she'll teach me how to take photos, she says maybe instead of refusing outright."

    an "That possibility means more than I could ever say, especially when it comes from someone like Zaina, who says no like it's a hobby."

    an "I go home that day with promises of maybe's in my heart and go to sleep with dreams of girls with stars in their eyes."
