    show finn smile

    an "I keep my mouth shut, not wanting to get on Zaina's nerves by agreeing with Finn, and not wanting to be a third person on Finn's back about being late even though he {i}was{/i} pretty late."

    f talk "Besides, I don't want her running off to do this stuff on her own again."
    show finn smile

    a talk "I wasn't going to..."
    show alex smile

    show paxton smile

    f talk "Hmmm... The basic rules would be good I guess."
    show finn smile

    an "He drums his fingers on the table for a moment before continuing."

    f talk "So generally, you don't actually break into places. The hospital you went to was unlocked right? That's fine, but breaking and entering is a bad idea."
    show finn smile

    z talk "I told her that already."
    show zaina smile

    f talk "It's never a bad reminder. What else... Oh, you know how at parks they always tell you 'take nothing but photos, leave nothing but footprints?' Same rule applies here."
    show finn smile

    f talk "You want it to look like you were never there."
    show finn smile

    f talk "You'll find cool stuff sometimes but you leave it for the next explorers to find."
    show finn smile

    a talk "That makes sense..."
    show alex smile

    show zaina smile

    z talk "There's something cool about capturing the process of urban decay on film..."
    show zaina smile

    f talk "Or memory card."
    show finn smile

    an "Zaina laughs a bit at that."

    z talk "These days, yeah."
    show zaina smile

    a talk "I did really like seeing all the photos on your account--that's what really inspired me to go and try it for myself."
    show alex smile

    f talk "By yourself."
    show finn smile

    a talk "And I won't do it again! Lesson learned!"
    show alex smile

    f talk "Good. I'll stop bringing it up. Maybe."
    show finn smile

    f talk "Really though, the idea is that if you get hurt, or something goes wrong, someone can go get help or call 911 for you."
    show finn smile

    f talk "Which, speaking of 911, sometimes we run into people when we're exploring."
    show finn smile

    p talk "Sometimes they're cops."
    show paxton smile

    z talk "They've been cops more than once..."
    show zaina smile

    f talk "Even so, don't run. Sometimes we've hidden, sometimes we're just up front that we're exploring and taking pictures."
    show finn smile

    p talk "But if you run, there's a good chance you're going to get hurt, or they're going to think you're doing something like vandalism."
    show paxton smile

    z talk "But we're only taking pictures of that."
    show zaina smile

    f talk "Are you prepared for that kind of thing?"
    show finn smile

    an "Considering I already almost got in trouble once..."

    a talk "Sure."
    show alex smile

    an "Might as well."

    an "I'd rather not get arrested, but... We'll just have to be careful."

    show finn smile

    show zaina smile

    f talk "Not now anyway."
    show finn smile

    a talk "I would need a mask for that, right?"
    show alex smile

    f talk "Yup. Unless you want cancer in 40 years."
    show finn smile

    a talk "I can't say I do."
    show alex smile

    f talk "Didn't think so. Anyway, that's most common in places that were built between the thirties and fifties."
    show finn smile

    a talk "Right. Even though it wasn't banned until the late seventies?"
    show alex smile

    f talk "Yeah. We're gonna be taking you to more... contemporary places, probably. Though it would be good to have gloves for that."
    show finn smile

    an "I nod along. So far everything they're telling me makes sense, and it's making my heart race."

    an "The same kind of giddy excitement I felt exploring the hospital I went to before."

    an "This is so unlike me, but..."

    an "I don't want to let this feeling go."

    z talk "You look awfully excited."
    show zaina smile
